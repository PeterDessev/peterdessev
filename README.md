## Hey there! 👋 I'm Peter

Undergrad **Electrical Engineer** surviving (and occasionally thriving) in **Boulder, Colorado** ⚡🏔️

I get the most satisfaction from building real, hands-on things: custom PCBs, mechanical assemblies, embedded code, and integrated systems - and then refining them relentlessly until every part just clicks.

### Tech stack & tools
- Core: KiCad, FreeCAD, C, Simetrix
- Currently exploring: Rust, Altium, AI/LLMs
- Daily drivers: Obsidian, Syncthing, GIMP

My favorite project so far: **[BP-1 Microprocessor](https://github.com/PeterDessev/ECEN-2350-Final-Project-SystemVerilog-CPU)** - a from-scratch 8-bit CPU written in SystemVerilog.

Schoolwork is intense right now, but I'm looking forward to sharing more projects soon.

### Fun facts
- Explored >400 music genres in 2025 alone 🎧🌍 (send help… or playlists)
- Native-level Bulgarian speaker 🇧🇬 (да, разбира се!)
- My all-time favorite movie: the Soviet cult classic White Sun of the Desert (1970)
- Hobbies: Deep-diving books, taking things apart, and the ongoing joy of fixing up my sister's house 🛠️

Feel free to say hi, star a repo, or open an issue - happy to chat about hardware, Rust, obscure music, or anything in between.
